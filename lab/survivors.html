						<h2> Meet Lexi's Survivors</h2>
						<p> My surviving plants consist of Katara (the Bonsai), Eva (the canna indica), Debra (the zebra succulent),
							Snake Gyllenhal (the snake plant), Ophelia (the orchid), Phillip (the fiddle leaf fig), Flora (the mini kalanchoe),
							Adelaid (the pothos), and several unnamed succulents. Wow! I have more than I realized! They survive on pure chance
							and will power. I have turned my outside studio into a plant rehab center. The plants that struggle to survive in my
							room from lack of sunlight, neglect, or cold temps move into the rehab until they recover enough to go back in. Its
							a vicious cycle that I do not recommend. I used to care too much for my plants and overwater them, I now neglect my
							poor plant babes a little more and have more success and less root rot. For any plant parent just starting out I
							would recommend a pothos aka devils ivy. You can do pretty much anything to these guys and they survive! Mine,
							Adelaid, has survived lots of different temps, levels of light, and several moves with me. I however would not
							recommend an orchid to a new plant parent, unless you want to feel like a failure. Ophelia is very tempermental,
							she currently just looks like a stick in a pot since its winter. I'm hoping she will get a little prettier again
							in the spring. If you're thinking of getting plant babes of your own I would highly suggest it! Indoor plants have
							been known to relieve stress and anxiety and promote healthy indoor air, plus they just look pretty!</p>

							<p> My surviving plants are my Chinese Money Plant (aka Pilea Peperomiodes),
						      Pink Anthurium, 2 full Pothos, 2 Pothos propagations, and a small Peace Lily plant! The only plants
								I have killed were my ivy and a succulent, I think my room didn't have enough light for them to live, rest in peace.
							I started my plant collection at the start of shelter in place, so I'm relatively new to keeping plants, but my favorite is my Anthurium.
						  It's so pretty and very easy to take care of. I would love to own a monstera plant in the future!</p>

							<h2> Meet Haley's Survivors</h2>
							<p> Plants that I have stuggled with keeping alive are my burrow's tail succulent, mimosa pudica, and mini monstera. The burrow's tail is
								an adorable succculent, but it is extremely picky about how you take care of it. One too many waterings and this guy's roots were entirely rotten,
								so what did I do in an attempt to bring it back to life? I cut the vines off where they met the soil. It sounds crazy that this did not end the
								plants life completely, but gave it a new one. Succulents are among some of the easiest plants to propogate and by letting the fresh cuts callus
								over before replanting the vines, I was able to prevent any further rotting. A little rehab outside and new roots grew. Another sensative plant I
								have that is barely holding on through winter is my mimosa pudica a.k.a. Shy Guy as I like to call him. These guys are tempermental and bratty,
								one touch to the leaves and they close themselves up. Not enough direct sunlight and their arms completely fall off. These guys are from the desert,
								and it doesn't like its new vacation home in the mountains, if he survives the winter I would be surprised. The last plant I can't understand how it
								has survived is my rhaphidophora tetrasperma, or mini monstera. I purchased this plant online and amidst a pandemic with insane postal delays. Upon
								receiving my package 3 weeks late, it looked as though someone raked leaves from their lawn and shipped it in a box. Underneath the dead stuff was a
								plant with 2 leaves attached. I contacted the company and they gave me my money back. A few days later, I noticed something green growing on the plant.
								It was coming back to life and it was free! I'm not going to say how much I paid origionally, but it turned out this plant was a steal and has been
								growing healthy ever since!

							<h2> Meet Raeann's Survivors</h2>
							<p> In my surviving plant collection are Dracena, Orchid, Croton,
								Peace Lily, and Hypoestes. The plant that is currently on its death
								bed is my Orchid, one of the flower stems have turned brown and is
								dying a slow death. The next one on the hit list is my Croton.
								The Croton requires direct sunlight but I may have given it too
								much vitamin D. My next plant that has already been put into the
								grown at a young age was my Hypoestes, went to water it one day
								to find bugs on it and never watered it since. Out of all the death
						    I have exposed my planets to, the Dracena and Peace Lily are going strong.
							  However, it has been said that the Peace Lily is very hard to kill but
							  I am still proud of myself for nameing Dracena as one of my survivors.</p>
