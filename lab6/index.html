			<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
			<p>In this lab we created a html file that is styled with a css file</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>I had a bit of a challenge linking the css file to my lab 6 but eventually
			figured it out. The picture on the page won't change its size so that's still a problem.
			It was also hard not working with a partner on this project.
			I guess I was a little late asking for a partner 3 days before the assignment
			was due but it worked itself out. However, it was still difficult figuring
			everything out on my own</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>I was able to get everything up and running on the website even without
			a partner but everything went smoothly.</p>
