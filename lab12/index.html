        <h1>Lab 12: Advanced Block-Level Styling II</h1>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>There were a few challenges I faced during this lab like getting
        the inages to align with the text.</p>
        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p>I still cound not fix the image problem but getting the text centered
        was successful.</p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>I am happy with the end results but still wished the images lined up
        with the text.</p>
