    <h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
    <p>In this lab, we had to create file structures and add index.html files</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had the hardest time linking the Lab 3 file struture to the index.html
      hyperlink and how to show the image in it.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>After trying to figure it out for 2 days on how to properly link the Lab 3
      File Sturcture to the hyperlink, I finally found the solution on what code
      would work for me. However, getting the image to attach itself to the
      Lab 3 was and still is a roung experience.</p>
