		<h1> Raeann Anaya</h1>
		<p> Hello, my name is Raeann Anaya. I am 21 years old, I was born in Grand
			Junction, Colorado but grew up in Merced. I am a movie buff, I could sit
			in front of the tv for hours. So much so that I want to get a career in
			the movie business at Pixar in hoping to create animation mvoies for them
			one day. I also love to play Sudoku, I refuse to play a game if it is not
			extremely difficult, I have been playing it for as long as I can remember.
			Fun fact, I actully won the Dominoes tournament at CSUMB. I also have an
			Associates Degree in Studio Art and in Art History. </p>
