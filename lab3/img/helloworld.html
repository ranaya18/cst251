  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <p>Hello we are Raeann and Mirna, this is our second project we have worked on
    together and it is going pretty well. But first let us introduce ourselves a
    little better,</p>

    <p>Hello, I'm Mirna Gonzalez. I am a 3rd year CSUMB student who just swiched majors,
    from Visual and Public Arts to Communication design, concentration in Visual Design.
    I hope that with the new skills I learn I can be a freelance Illustrator
    (who finally knows how to use photoshop!)or work as a storyboard/concept artist working for an animation studio.
    So far pair work has been going well and Raeann is a good teammate, very patience and understanding.
    But I'm starting to get why its better to have a partner when it comes to coding, you learn together and
    help eachother out.</p>

    <p>Hello, I am Raeann Anaya, I am a 3rd year at CSUMB. I recently switched my
    major from Cinema Arts and Technology to Communication Deisgn and my concentration
    is in Game Design. I want to pursue a career in the movie business but less
    behind the camera and more with the editing part of it, Pixar is the place I
    am aiming for for a career. However, pair working has been super helpful especially
    having the same partner twice, it gets you more comfortable working with
    someone and you get to build a friendship. Also, I do not have expeince
    in coding but doing work like this makes it more fun.</p>
