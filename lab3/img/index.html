    <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
    <p> In this lab, we had to create file structure and add index.html files</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had the hardest time linking the Lab 3 File Structure to the index.html
    hyperlink and how to show the image in it. </p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>After trying to figure it out for 2 days how to properly link the Lab 3
    File Structure to the hyperlink, I finally found the solution on what code would
    work for me. However, getting the image to attach itself to the Lab 3 FIle
    Structure was and still is a rough experince</p>
