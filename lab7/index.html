      <h1>Lab 7: Intro to CSS</h1>
      <p>In this lab we work more with CSS and styling it to our preferences.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>There weren't any challenges I came across while doing this assignemnt. I
        got more comfortable using CSS since we used it in lab 6.</p>
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>The only probelms I had were finding the right size to put my picture and
        thickness around my borader.</p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>I wish I could've incorporated more shapes and colors into my website but
      I am happy with the results.</p>
