      <h1>Lab 16: Fancy CSS II</h1>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I had two challenges in this lab. It was trying to get the picture
        to stay right and the text to stay left.</p>
      <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p>I honestly do not know what happened to this CSS but the text and picture
        would not stay in their areas.</p>
      <h4>Results</h4>
        <p> I am not happy with how my lab turned out, it was harder than I
          thought.</p>
