        <h1>Lab 11: Advanced Block-Level Styling 1</h1>
        <p>in this lab we are woring on block styling.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I had multiple challenges during this lab. I was having a hard time
        putting the aside bar in the website.</p>
        <h3>Probelms</h3>
        <p>I had a problem adding a background image. I didn't know how to have
        two images on the oppisite side of the website from eachtoher. Also I was
        confused on how to write our facts about us.</p>
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>The website looks okay for the project. Although I didn't finish
        everything I wanted to do, it still looks okay.</p>
